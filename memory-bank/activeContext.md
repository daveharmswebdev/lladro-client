# Active Context

## Current Focus

- Finalizing `DoerTable.vue` implementation.
- Updating `DoerTable.stories.ts` and `DoerTable.spec.ts`.
- Updating memory bank documentation.

## Recent Changes

- **`DoerTable.vue` Implementation:**
  - Added `doers` prop to accept an array of `Doer` objects.
  - Implemented table display with columns: ID, First Name, Last Name, Total Todos.
  - Added a message "You currently do not have any doers." when the `doers` prop is empty or undefined.
  - Implemented pagination:
    - Displays 5 doers per page.
    - Includes "Previous", "Next", and page number buttons.
    - Buttons are disabled appropriately (e.g., "Previous" on first page, "Next" on last page).
  - Implemented sorting:
    - Clicking on column headers (ID, First Name, Last Name, Total Todos) sorts the table.
    - Clicking a sorted column header again reverses the sort order.
    - Sort indicators (▲/▼) are displayed on the active sort column.
- **`DoerTable.stories.ts` Update:**
  - Updated `argTypes` to include the `doers` prop.
  - Updated existing stories (`Default`, `NoDoers`, `ThreeDoers`) to pass data via the `doers` prop.
  - Renamed `ThirteenDoersPaginated` to `ThirteenDoers` and updated it to pass all 13 mock doers, demonstrating pre-pagination data supply.
- **`DoerTable.spec.ts` Update:**
  - Replaced placeholder tests with comprehensive unit tests covering:
    - Rendering the table title.
    - "No doers" message display.
    - Correct display of table headers and doer data.
    - Pagination functionality (items per page, controls, navigation, button states).
    - Sorting functionality (by each column, ascending/descending, sort indicators).
  - Resolved ESLint and TypeScript errors related to `VueWrapper` typing.
- **Navbar Implementation (Previous):**
  - Created `src/components/TheNavbar.vue` with links to Home, Doers, Todos, and Regions.
  - Integrated `TheNavbar.vue` into `src/App.vue`.
- **View Creation (Previous):**
  - Created `src/views/DoersView.vue`.
  - Created `src/views/TodosView.vue` (stub).
  - Created `src/views/RegionsView.vue` (stub).
- **Router Configuration (Previous):**
  - Updated `src/router/index.ts` to include routes for `/`, `/doers`, `/todos`, and `/regions`.
- **Doer Components (Previous):**
  - Integrated `DoerForm.vue` and `DoerTable.vue` into `src/views/DoersView.vue`.
  - `DoersView.vue` now handles `DoerForm` submission (currently logs to console and adds to a local reactive list).
- **`DoerForm.vue` Update (Previous):**
  - Modified `DoerForm.vue` to emit `submit-form` with a payload: `{ firstName: string; lastName: string }`.
- **`doer.model.ts` Update (Previous):**
  - Updated `Doer` interface to include `totalTodos?: number`.

## Next Steps

- Implement actual state management for 'Doers' (e.g., using Pinia) in `DoersView.vue` to connect `DoerForm` and `DoerTable`.
- Style the application, including the navbar and new views/components.
- Address any remaining Vetur path alias errors if they persist.
- Implement editing and deleting 'Doers'.
- Flesh out `TodosView.vue` and `RegionsView.vue`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- The `DoerTable.vue` component is now fully featured as per the initial requirements in `.clinerules/03-Doer.md`.
- The `id` field for a `Doer` is still managed by `DoersView.vue` (using `Date.now()`). This will need a more robust solution when integrating with a backend or more permanent client-side storage.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- Follow Vue.js best practices.
- Maintain clean and readable code.
- Use Single File Components (.vue files).
- Ensure components are well-tested with unit tests (Vitest) and showcased in Storybook.

## Learnings & Project Insights

- Complex component logic (like pagination and sorting) can be effectively managed within the component's `<script setup>` using `ref` and `computed` properties.
- Vue Test Utils (`@vue/test-utils`) provides powerful tools for testing component interactions, props, and emitted events.
- Careful typing with `VueWrapper` and component instance types is important for robust and error-free unit tests in TypeScript.
