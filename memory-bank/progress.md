# Progress

## What Works

- Basic Vue.js application structure is in place.
- Default boilerplate code has been removed.
- A simple "Home Page" is displayed at the root route (`/`).
- The application can be run using `npm run dev`.
- **Doer Creation Form (`src/components/DoerForm.vue`):**
  - Enhanced stateless (presentational) component.
  - Accepts `firstName`, `lastName`, and `mode` ('create' | 'edit') as props.
  - Implements validation for `firstName` and `lastName` (required, 25-character limit).
  - Displays error messages for invalid inputs.
  - Submit button text changes based on `mode` ('Create' or 'Update').
  - Submit button is disabled if the form is invalid.
  - Emits `update:firstName`, `update:lastName` for two-way binding, and `submit-form` on valid submission.
- **Doer Form Unit Tests (`src/components/__tests__/DoerForm.spec.ts`):**
  - Comprehensive unit tests created using Vitest and Vue Test Utils.
  - Tests cover rendering in different modes, input handling, validation logic, button states, and event emissions.
- **Integration with Home View (`src/views/HomeView.vue`):**
  - `DoerForm.vue` is integrated into `HomeView.vue`.
  - `HomeView.vue` manages the form's input state and handles submission (currently displays data and clears form).
- `tsconfig.app.json` updated with `"baseUrl": "."` to potentially aid IDE path alias resolution.

## What's Left to Build

- **Core 'Doer' Functionality (replacing generic 'Todo' context for now):**
  - Data model for 'Doer' items (exists: `src/models/doer.model.ts`).
  - Components for:
    - Displaying a list of 'Doers'.
    - Displaying an individual 'Doer' item.
    - Editing an existing 'Doer' (The `DoerForm` now supports an 'edit' mode, but integration into a workflow is needed).
    - Deleting a 'Doer'.
    - (Functionality like 'marking complete' might not apply to 'Doers' unless their role evolves).
  - Adding a new 'Doer' is implemented with the enhanced `DoerForm.vue`.
- **State Management for 'Doers':** (e.g., Pinia, or a simple reactive array in a composable for now).
- **Styling:** Enhanced styling for 'Doer' components and overall application.
- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests (Vitest) for `HomeView.vue` (to ensure it correctly handles the updated `DoerForm` props and events, especially the new `mode` prop if `HomeView` starts managing edit functionality), and other future components/logic.
  - Component tests/showcase (Storybook) for `DoerForm.vue` and other UI components.
  - End-to-end tests (Playwright) for user flows involving 'Doers'.
- **Persistence:** (Optional, e.g., using local storage or a backend API for 'Doers').
- **ID Generation:** Strategy for assigning `id` to new 'Doers'.

## Current Status

- **Phase:** Feature Development - Doer Form Enhancements & Testing.
- The `DoerForm.vue` component has been significantly enhanced with validation (required fields, character limits), error messages, and distinct 'create'/'edit' modes, guided by `.clinerules/03-Doer.md`.
- Comprehensive unit tests for `DoerForm.vue` are complete.
- The form remains integrated into `HomeView.vue`, which currently handles basic data submission for creation.
- The project is ready for the next steps, such as implementing state management for 'Doers' and unit testing `HomeView.vue`.

## Known Issues

- **IDE Path Resolution:** Vetur/Volar (Vue language server in VS Code) might initially show errors for `@/*` path aliases in `src/views/HomeView.vue` (e.g., "Cannot find module..."). The update to `tsconfig.app.json` (adding `"baseUrl": "."`) aims to fix this. If errors persist, restarting the VS Code TypeScript server (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P > "TypeScript: Restart TS server") or VS Code itself is recommended.
- The application currently has no persistent storage or advanced state management for 'Doers'.
- Styling is minimal.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Decision (Implicit):** Start with a fresh Vue CLI project.
- **First Action:** Remove boilerplate to create a clean slate.
- **DoerForm Design:** Decided to implement `DoerForm.vue` as a stateless (presentational) component based on user feedback/preference, to improve testability and Storybook compatibility. This involves passing form field values as props and emitting events for updates and submission.
- **ESLint/Template Typing:** Refactored event handling in `DoerForm.vue` to use methods in `<script setup>` for type assertions (`as HTMLInputElement`) instead of direct assertions in the template, resolving ESLint parsing errors.
- **DoerForm Enhancements (Current Task):** Updated `DoerForm.vue` to include validation (required, character limits), error display, and 'create'/'edit' modes with corresponding button text and disabled states, as specified in `.clinerules/03-Doer.md`. Unit tests were created to cover this new logic.
